# Self-Compassion Box â€” Cute & Peaceful (Vite + React + Tailwind)

This is a small demo project with:
- 25 theme buttons
- Random image+text card popup
- Background music (external URL)
- Floating pastel animations
- `sampleCards.js` separated for your images/text

How to run (recommended: Vite):
1. Ensure Node.js (18+) and npm are installed.
2. Install deps:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Run dev server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Build for production:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

You can edit `src/sampleCards.js` to add your own card images and text (20 cards per theme recommended).
